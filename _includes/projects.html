    <h3> INTERPLANETARY CARGO </h3>
    <p>Humans just reached interplanetary travel. This allowed them to visit other planets in days. Suddenly there were planets to colonize in our Solar System. The only problem they faced were supplies which they could not produce in the host planet. To tackle this problem the United Planet Government assembled a fleet of cargo spacecrafts that would deliver goods around the Solar System. Things were going well until some of the Captains commanding the spacecrafts started to go rough and turned to Space Piracy. These space pirates started to attack other spacecrafts to steal their goods. This made interplanetary travelling difficult. Against all odds the cargo spacecrafts must make sure their goods have been delivered to the destined planet.</p>

    <h3> Jump Race 3D </h3>
    <p>The main objective is to get to the final floating stage which is green in colour and looks different from other stages. On the way there will be other AI racers that will try to reach the final stage before the player. The AI racers can be killed by colliding with them or by breaking some stages. The player dies when falling into the water or colliding with the big floating windmill fan obstacle. There is a booster pick up which helps the player to travel further. Once the player reachs the final stage a new random stage will be generated.</p>
